        <p>8.3 Customizing Git - Git Hooks
            Git Hooks
            Like many other Version Control Systems, Git has a way to fire off custom scripts when certain important actions occur. There are two groups of these hooks: client-side and server-side. Client-side hooks are triggered by operations such as committing and merging, while server-side hooks run on network operations such as receiving pushed commits. You can use these hooks for all sorts of reasons.
            
            Installing a Hook
            The hooks are all stored in the hooks subdirectory of the Git directory. In most projects, that’s .git/hooks. When you initialize a new repository with git init, Git populates the hooks directory with a bunch of example scripts, many of which are useful by themselves; but they also document the input values of each script. All the examples are written as shell scripts, with some Perl thrown in, but any properly named executable scripts will work fine – you can write them in Ruby or Python or whatever language you are familiar with. If you want to use the bundled hook scripts, you’ll have to rename them; their file names all end with .sample.
            
            To enable a hook script, put a file in the hooks subdirectory of your .git directory that is named appropriately (without any extension) and is executable. From that point forward, it should be called. We’ll cover most of the major hook filenames here.
            
            Client-Side Hooks
            There are a lot of client-side hooks. This section splits them into committing-workflow hooks, email-workflow scripts, and everything else.

                Committing-Workflow Hooks
The first four hooks have to do with the committing process.

The pre-commit hook is run first, before you even type in a commit message. It’s used to inspect the snapshot that’s about to be committed, to see if you’ve forgotten something, to make sure tests run, or to examine whatever you need to inspect in the code. Exiting non-zero from this hook aborts the commit, although you can bypass it with git commit --no-verify. You can do things like check for code style (run lint or something equivalent), check for trailing whitespace (the default hook does exactly this), or check for appropriate documentation on new methods.

The prepare-commit-msg hook is run before the commit message editor is fired up but after the default message is created. It lets you edit the default message before the commit author sees it. This hook takes a few parameters: the path to the file that holds the commit message so far, the type of commit, and the commit SHA-1 if this is an amended commit. This hook generally isn’t useful for normal commits; rather, it’s good for commits where the default message is auto-generated, such as templated commit messages, merge commits, squashed commits, and amended commits. You may use it in conjunction with a commit template to programmatically insert information.

The commit-msg hook takes one parameter, which again is the path to a temporary file that contains the commit message written by the developer. If this script exits non-zero, Git aborts the commit process, so you can use it to validate your project state or commit message before allowing a commit to go through. In the last section of this chapter, we’ll demonstrate using this hook to check that your commit message is conformant to a required pattern.

After the entire commit process is completed, the post-commit hook runs. It doesn’t take any parameters, but you can easily get the last commit by running git log -1 HEAD. Generally, this script is used for notification or something similar.

                Email Workflow Hooks
You can set up three client-side hooks for an email-based workflow. They’re all invoked by the git am command, so if you aren’t using that command in your workflow, you can safely skip to the next section. If you’re taking patches over email prepared by git format-patch, then some of these may be helpful to you.

The first hook that is run is applypatch-msg. It takes a single argument: the name of the temporary file that contains the proposed commit message. Git aborts the patch if this script exits non-zero. You can use this to make sure a commit message is properly formatted, or to normalize the message by having the script edit it in place.

The next hook to run when applying patches via git am is pre-applypatch. Somewhat confusingly, it is run after the patch is applied but before a commit is made, so you can use it to inspect the snapshot before making the commit. You can run tests or otherwise inspect the working tree with this script. If something is missing or the tests don’t pass, exiting non-zero aborts the git am script without committing the patch.

The last hook to run during a git am operation is post-applypatch, which runs after the commit is made. You can use it to notify a group or the author of the patch you pulled in that you’ve done so. You can’t stop the patching process with this script.
